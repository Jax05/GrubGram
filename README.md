# GRUBGRAM - A food delivery photo review app

This is the MVP for GrubGram. An app that let's you review your food delivery through photos. It was inspired by Yelp and Instagram and has many features planned.

## Browse the app

Currently, you can browse all photos and restaurants on the app without creating an account. Nobody likes forced account creation walls :(

## Create an account

You'll need to create an account if you want access to full app functionality. Simply sign up or log in with your email or Google account to start uploading photos. Don't forget to rate your pics and give a short description if you so choose.

## Feel good about a bias free platform

We created GrubGram to brige the gap between customers, restaurants, and third party delivery apps with the hopes of helping maintain high quality standards across the board. Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to help out and stay tuned for more features being released soon.
